# Shallow Water Equation

Develop a C++ program to solve the shallow water equations using the Finite Difference method with a sixth order central difference for the spatial discretization and a fourth order Runge-Kutta method for the temporal discretization. Confirm that the algorithm is stable and write the h field solution in the form of a .csv that can be opened and visualised in Paraview.
